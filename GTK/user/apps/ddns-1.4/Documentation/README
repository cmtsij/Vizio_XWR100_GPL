----] Description

Updatedd is a program which updates your dyndns settings for you, it enables 
you to fully automatically update those kind of services in case
that your ip changes and you dont have the time or recognize that it changed.

----] How to compile/install

Type:

make
make install

thats all ;-)
If you want to uninstall updatedd type:

make uninstall


----] The technical background

Updatedd is divided into several dynamic librarys which where called
from the main program. Each of these libraries is for one service.
They are located at /usr/local/lib/updatedd/. There is a link in this
folder called default.so which points to the default service.
After installation it points to dyndns.so. You can edit this link, of course.
But you can also use the non-default services by running updatedd
with the -S <service> flag.

Example:
updatedd -S ovh

The librarys have all a usage of its own. Thats why the services and
protocols are very different.
Type updatedd --help to get the usage of the default library or
type updatedd -S <service> --help to get the usage of your chosen service.
If only need one of these services (libraries) you can remove the other,
but not the link default.so!


----] Security advisory

If you like your system you should not have updatedd suid root
and only root should be able to change the default.so link.
Otherwise it is possible for normal users to execute another
library. Thus, not authorized users can get root.
