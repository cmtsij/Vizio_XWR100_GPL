Create an new SSL certificate for HTTP server

1.Log into a Linux workstation to use openssl

2.Create a private key: ca-key.pem

openssl genrsa -out ca-key.pem 1024

3.Create a certificate and sign it ourself: ca-cert.pem

openssl req -new -x509 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem -days 3650

You can specify any length of days for expiration (3650 = 10 years)

Then you need to input the following information:

Country Name: TW
State or Province Name: Taiwan
Locality Name: Hsinchu
Organization Name: Gemtek
Organizational Unit Name: SWD
Common Name: WRT600N.com
Email Address: ignore(enter) or any

These information can be seen by user through browser when SSL is open
Common Name is recommended to use your router's domain name 
so that there will be no warning in the browser's message when you use domain name to access GUI

4.Create the "mini_httpd.pem" file for httpd to use:

Simply concatenate ca-key.pem and ca-cert.pem into one file named "mini_httpd.pem" by text editor

Example looks like this:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
content...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
content...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

5.Put "mini_httpd.pem" into httpd folder
