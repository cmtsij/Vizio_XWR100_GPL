	1.	Just for the WAN status control ( LEDs ), because Linksys WRT55AG needn't this feature.
		So I added a extra CFLAG, its name is "RemoveWANLedControl". If you don't add it, then it
		will add the WAN status control SRC. If you add it, then it will not involve the WAN status control
		SRC.
	2.	So overall, this revision SRC tree integrate the Motorola WR850G and Linksys WRT55AG revisions
		into the single SRC tree.

	1.	Now, this SRC tree has involved the Gateway features.
		Just for the Gateway, it's complete same as Moto revision, except the DHCP client must not
		output any message on the console.
