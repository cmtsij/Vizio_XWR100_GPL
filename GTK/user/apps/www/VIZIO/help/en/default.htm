	<h2><a name="FindingLocation">Finding a Location for Your Router</a></h2>
	<p>Here are some things you should consider when deciding on a proper location for your router:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Place your router as close as possible to the center of your wireless network devices. Your connection will be stronger the closer your devices are to your router. Typical indoor operating range is up to 200 feet. </li>
			<li>Avoid placing your router near devices that may emit "noise", including microwave ovens, refrigerators, and metal cabinets. If your signal seems weak, make sure that objects are not blocking the signal’s path between your device and your router.</li>
			<li>For proper ventilation, you must allow at least 4 inches (10 cm) on all sides of your router.  </li>
			<li>Avoid installing your router in places with high humidity, dust, or smoke so you do not shorten the service life of the electronic components.</li>
			<li>Read this user manual carefully before setting up your router.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2><a name="WallMounting">Wall-Mounting Placement</a></h2>
	<p>Your router has two wall-mount slots on the bottom panel.</p>
	<p><span class="note">Note:</span> VIZIO is not responsible for damages incurred by insecure wall-mounting hardware.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Choose a wall that is within reach of an electrical outlet and is smooth and sturdy.</li>
		<li>Drill two holes 6 inches (152 mm) apart into the wall.</li>
		<li>Insert a screw into each hole leaving 0.12 inches (3 mm) of the screw head exposed.</li>
		<li>Line up the wall-mount slots on the bottom of your router with the screws and slide the router down until the screws fit snugly into the wall-mount slots.</li>

	<h1><a name="WirelessSecurity">Chapter 6 Wireless Security Information</a></h1>
	<p>Wireless networking, like any radio signal that travels through the air, can be intercepted by other devices. Here's how you can protect the information that travels over your wireless network:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><span class="important">Change the default wireless network name (SSID)</span><br />The name of your wireless network is called a Service Set Identifier (SSID) and was set by the factory. Your VIZIO router has three SSIDs (see <a href="#Features">Features</a> for information about your SSIDs). Consider changing the network name to something unique to make sure it is not the same as other wireless networks that your router may detect in the area. Do not use personal information because others with will be able to see that when searching for a wireless network.</li>
		<li><span class="important">Set a username and password</span><br />From the factory no username or password is set to open the Router Settings App. To keep your router safe from hackers, set a username and password. See <a href="#RouterAutoLogin">Router Auto Login</a> for information on setting a username and password.</li>
		<li><span class="important">Hide your Network Name (SSID)</span><br />Hide your network name (SSID) so people who are not on your network cannot see it in their list of available networks. To hide your SSID:</li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Select the <span class="important">Wireless </span>menu option.</li>
			<li>Click <span class="important">Advanced</span>.</li>
			<li>Select the <span class="important">Off </span>button next to 
			<span class="italic">SSID Broadcast</span>.</li>
			<li>Click <span class="important">Save Changes</span>.</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>

	<p><span class="important">General Network Security Guidelines</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Password-protect all computers on the network and individually password protect sensitive files.</li>
		<li>Change passwords on a regular basis.</li>
		<li>Install anti-virus software and personal firewall software.</li>
		<li>Disable file sharing (peer-to-peer). Some applications may open file sharing without your consent and/or knowledge.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><span class="important">Additional Security Tips </span> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep your router away from exterior walls and windows.</li>
		<li>Use strong passphrases that are at least eight characters in length. Combine letters and numbers to avoid using standard words that can be found in the dictionary.</li>
	</ul>
