                  =============================
                  Release Notes for Samba 3.0.2
                        February 9, 2004
                  =============================

This is the latest stable release of Samba. This is the version 
that all production Samba servers should be running for all current
bug-fixes.  

It has been confirmed that previous versions of Samba 3.0 are
susceptible to a password initialization bug that could grant an 
attacker unauthorized access to a user account created by the
mksmbpasswd.sh shell script.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0082 to this issue.

Samba administrators not wishing to upgrade to the current 
version should download the 3.0.2 release, build the pdbedit 
tool, and run 

   root# pdbedit-3.0.2 --force-initialized-passwords
      
This will disable all accounts not possessing a valid password
(e.g. the password field has been set a string of X's).

Samba servers running 3.0.2 are not vulnerable to this bug 
regardless of whether or not pdbedit has been used to sanitize
the passdb backend.

Some of the more visible bugs in 3.0.1 addressed in the 3.0.2
release include:

  o Joining a Samba domain from Pre-SP2 Windows 2000 clients.
  o Logging onto a Samba domain from Windows XP clients.
  o Problems with the %U and %u smb.conf variables in relation to 
    Windows 9x/ME clients.
  o Kerberos failures due to an invalid in memory keytab detection
    test.
  o Updates to the ntlm_auth tool.
  o Fixes for various SMB signing errors.
  o Better separation of WINS and DNS queries for domain controllers.
  o Issues with nss_winbind FreeBSD and Solaris.
  o Several crash bugs in smbd and winbindd.
  o Output formatting fixes for smbclient for better compatibility
    with scripts based on the 2.2 version.

o   Correct the "smbldap_open: cannot access when not root error"
    messages when looking up group information (bug 281).

o   Correct parsing issues with munged dial string.
o   Fix bugs in quota support for XFS.
o   Add a cleaner method for applications that need to provide 
    name->SID mappings to do this via NSS rather than having to 
    know the winbindd pipe protocol.
o   Adds a variant of the winbindd_getgroups() call called 
    winbindd_getusersids() that provides direct SID->SIDs listing of 
    a users supplementary groups. This is enough to allow non-Samba 
    applications to do ACL checking.
o   Make sure we don't append the 'ldap suffix' when writing out the 
    'ldap XXX suffix' values in SWAT (bug 328).
o   Fix renames across file systems.
o   Ensure that items in a list of strings containing whitespace are 
    written out surrounded by single quotes.  This means that both

    authentication.
o   Change the name of the job passed off to cups from "Test Page" 
    to "smbprn.00000033 Test Page" so that we can get the smb 
    jobid back. This allow users to delete jobs with cups printing 
    backend (partial work on bug 770).
o   Fix build of winbindd with static pdb modules.
o   Retrieve the correct ACL group bits if the file has an ACL 
    (bug 802).
o   Implement "net rpc group members": Get members of a domain group 
    in human-readable format.
o   Add MacOSX (Darwin) specific charset module code.
o   Use samr_dispinfo(level == 1) for enumerating domain users so we

              =======================================
              The original 3.0.0 release notes follow	       
              =======================================


Major new features:
-------------------

1)  Active Directory support.  Samba 3.0 is now able to  
    join a ADS realm as a member server and authenticate 
    users using LDAP/Kerberos.

2)  Unicode support. Samba will now negotiate UNICODE on the wire 
    and internally there is now a much better infrastructure for 
    multi-byte and UNICODE character sets.

3)  New authentication system. The internal authentication system 
    has been almost completely rewritten. Most of the changes are 
    internal, but the new auth system is also very configurable.

4)  New default filename mangling system.

5)  A new "net" command has been added. It is somewhat similar to 
    the "net" command in windows. Eventually we plan to replace 
    numerous other utilities (such as smbpasswd) with subcommands 
    in "net".

6)  Samba now negotiates NT-style status32 codes on the wire. This
    improves error handling a lot.

7)  Better Windows 2000/XP/2003 printing support including publishing
    printer attributes in active directory.

8)  New loadable module support for passdb backends and character 
    sets.

9)  New default dual-daemon winbindd support for better performance.

10) Support for migrating from a Windows NT 4.0 domain to a Samba 
    domain and maintaining user, group and domain SIDs.

11) Support for establishing trust relationships with Windows NT 4.0
    domain controllers.
  
12) Initial support for a distributed Winbind architecture using
    an LDAP directory for storing SID to uid/gid mappings.
  
13) Major updates to the Samba documentation tree.

14) Full support for client and server SMB signing to ensure
    compatibility with default Windows 2003 security settings.

15) Improvement of ACL mapping features based on code donated by
    Andreas Grünbacher.


Plus lots of other improvements!


Additional Documentation
------------------------

Please refer to Samba documentation tree (included in the docs/ 
subdirectory) for extensive explanations of installing, configuring
and maintaining Samba 3.0 servers and clients.  It is advised to 
begin with the Samba-HOWTO-Collection for overviews and specific 
tasks (the current book is up to approximately 400 pages) and to 
refer to the various man pages for information on individual options.

We are very glad to be able to include the second edition of
"Using Samba" by Jay Ts, Robert Eckstein, and David Collier-Brown
(O'Reilly & Associates) in this release.  The book is available
on-line at http://samba.org/samba/docs/ and is included with 
the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT).  Thanks to the authors and
publisher for making "Using Samba" under the GNU Free Documentation 
License.


######################################################################
Upgrading from a previous Samba 3.0 beta
########################################

Beginning with Samba 3.0.0beta3, the RID allocation functions
have been moved into winbindd.  Previously these were handled
by each passdb backend.  This means that winbindd must be running
to automatically allocate RIDs for users and/or groups.  Otherwise,
smbd will use the 2.2 algorithm for generating new RIDs.

If you are using 'passdb backend = tdbsam' with a previous Samba 
3.0 beta release (or possibly alpha), it may be necessary to 
move the RID_COUNTER entry from /usr/local/samba/private/passdb.tdb
to winbindd_idmap.tdb.  To do this:

1)  Ensure that winbindd_idmap.tdb exists (launch winbindd at least 
    once)
2)  build tdbtool by executing 'make tdbtool' in the source/tdb/ 
    directory
3)  run: (note that 'tdb>' is the tool's prompt for input)

       root# ./tdbtool /usr/local/samba/private/passdb.tdb
       tdb> show RID_COUNTER
       key 12 bytes
       RID_COUNTER
       data 4 bytes
       [000] 0A 52 00 00                                       .R.

       tdb> move RID_COUNTER /usr/local/samba/var/locks/winbindd_idmap.tdb
       ....
       record moved

If you are using 'passdb backend = ldapsam', it will be necessary to 
store idmap entries in the LDAP directory as well (i.e. idmap backend 
= ldap).  Refer to the 'net idmap' command for more information on 
migrating SID<->UNIX id mappings from one backend to another.

If the RID_COUNTER record does not exist, then these instructions are
unneccessary and the new RID_COUNTER record will be correctly generated
if needed.

                        various db tables via the winreg RPCs


Changes in Behavior
-------------------

The following issues are known changes in behavior between Samba 2.2 and 
Samba 3.0 that may affect certain installations of Samba.

  1)  When operating as a member of a Windows domain, Samba 2.2 would 
      map any users authenticated by the remote DC to the 'guest account'
      if a uid could not be obtained via the getpwnam() call.  Samba 3.0
      rejects the connection as NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE.  There is no 
      current work around to re-establish the 2.2 behavior.
      
  2)  When adding machines to a Samba 2.2 controlled domain, the 
      'add user script' was used to create the UNIX identity of the 
      machine trust account.  Samba 3.0 introduces a new 'add machine 
      script' that must be specified for this purpose.  Samba 3.0 will
      not fall back to using the 'add user script' in the absence of 
      an 'add machine script'
  

######################################################################
Passdb Backends and Authentication
##################################

There have been a few new changes that Samba administrators should be
aware of when moving to Samba 3.0.

  1) encrypted passwords have been enabled by default in order to 
     inter-operate better with out-of-the-box Windows client 
     installations.  This does mean that either (a) a samba account
     must be created for each user, or (b) 'encrypt passwords = no'
     must be explicitly defined in smb.conf.
    
  2) Inclusion of new 'security = ads' option for integration 
     with an Active Directory domain using the native Windows
     Kerberos 5 and LDAP protocols.

     MIT kerberos 1.3.1 supports the ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 encryption 
     type which is neccessary for servers on which the 
     administrator password has not been changed, or kerberos-enabled 
     SMB connections to servers that require Kerberos SMB signing.
     Besides this one difference, either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos
     distributions are usable by Samba 3.0.
     

Samba 3.0 also includes the possibility of setting up chains
of authentication methods (auth methods) and account storage 
backends (passdb backend).  Please refer to the smb.conf(5) 
man page for details.  While both parameters assume sane default 
values, it is likely that you will need to understand what the 
values actually mean in order to ensure Samba operates correctly.

The recommended passdb backends at this time are

  * smbpasswd - 2.2 compatible flat file format
  * tdbsam - attribute rich database intended as an smbpasswd
    replacement for stand alone servers
  * ldapsam - attribute rich account storage and retrieval 
    backend utilizing an LDAP directory.  
  * ldapsam_compat - a 2.2 backward compatible LDAP account 
    backend
    
Certain functions of the smbpasswd(8) tool have been split between the 
new smbpasswd(8) utility, the net(8) tool, and the new pdbedit(8) 
utility.  See the respective man pages for details.
    
     
######################################################################
LDAP
####

This section outlines the new features affecting Samba / LDAP 
integration.

New Schema
----------
  
A new object class (sambaSamAccount) has been introduced to replace 
the old sambaAccount.  This change aids us in the renaming of 
attributes to prevent clashes with attributes from other vendors.  
There is a conversion script (examples/LDAP/convertSambaAccount) to 
modify and LDIF file to the new schema.
  
Example:
  
  $ ldapsearch .... -b "ou=people,dc=..." > sambaAcct.ldif
  $ convertSambaAccount --sid=<Domain SID> \
    --input=sambaAcct.ldif --output=sambaSamAcct.ldif \
    --changetype=[modify|add]
	
The <DOM SID> can be obtained by running 'net getlocalsid 
<DOMAINNAME>' on the Samba PDC as root.  The changetype determines 
the format of the generated LDIF output--either create new entries 
or modify existing entries.
    
The old sambaAccount schema may still be used by specifying the 
"ldapsam_compat" passdb backend.  However, the sambaAccount and
associated attributes have been moved to the historical section of
the schema file and must be uncommented before use if needed.
The 2.2 object class declaration for a sambaAccount has not changed
in the 3.0 samba.schema file. 
  
Other new object classes and their uses include:
  
  * sambaDomain - domain information used to allocate rids 
    for users and groups as necessary.  The attributes are added
    in 'ldap suffix' directory entry automatically if 
    an idmap uid/gid range has been set and the 'ldapsam'
    passdb backend has been selected.
      
  * sambaGroupMapping - an object representing the 
    relationship between a posixGroup and a Windows
    group/SID.  These entries are stored in the 'ldap 
    group suffix' and managed by the 'net groupmap' command.
    
  * sambaUnixIdPool - created in the 'ldap idmap suffix' entry 
    automatically and contains the next available 'idmap uid' and 
    'idmap gid'
    
  * sambaIdmapEntry - object storing a mapping between a 
    SID and a UNIX uid/gid.  These objects are created by the 
    idmap_ldap module as needed.

  * sambaSidEntry - object representing a SID alone, as a Structural
    class on which to build the sambaIdmapEntry.

    
New Suffix for Searching
------------------------
  
The following new smb.conf parameters have been added to aid in directing
certain LDAP queries when 'passdb backend = ldapsam://...' has been
specified.

  * ldap suffix         - used to search for user and computer accounts
  * ldap user suffix    - used to store user accounts
  * ldap machine suffix - used to store machine trust accounts
  * ldap group suffix   - location of posixGroup/sambaGroupMapping entries
  * ldap idmap suffix   - location of sambaIdmapEntry objects

If an 'ldap suffix' is defined, it will be appended to all of the 
remaining sub-suffix parameters.  In this case, the order of the suffix
listings in smb.conf is important.  Always place the 'ldap suffix' first
in the list.  

Due to a limitation in Samba's smb.conf parsing, you should not surround 
the DN's with quotation marks.


IdMap LDAP support
------------------

Samba 3.0 supports an ldap backend for the idmap subsystem.  The 
following options would inform Samba that the idmap table should be
stored on the directory server onterose in the "ou=idmap,dc=plainjoe,
dc=org" partition.

 [global]
    ...
    idmap backend     = ldap:ldap://onterose/
    ldap idmap suffix = ou=idmap,dc=plainjoe,dc=org
    idmap uid         = 40000-50000
    idmap gid         = 40000-50000

This configuration allows winbind installations on multiple servers to
share a uid/gid number space, thus avoiding the interoperability problems
with NFS that were present in Samba 2.2.
    


######################################################################
Trust Relationships and a Samba Domain
######################################

Samba 3.0.0beta2 is able to utilize winbindd as the means of 
allocating uids and gids to trusted users and groups.  More
information regarding Samba's support for establishing trust 
relationships can be found in the Samba-HOWTO-Collection included
in the docs/ directory of this release.

First create your Samba PDC and ensure that everything is 
working correctly before moving on the trusts.

To establish Samba as the trusting domain (named SAMBA) from a Windows NT
4.0 domain named WINDOWS:

  1) create the trust account for SAMBA in "User Manager for Domains"
  2) connect the trust from the Samba domain using
     'net rpc trustdom establish GLASS'

To create a trustlationship with SAMBA as the trusted domain:

  1) create the initial trust account for GLASS using
     'smbpasswd -a -i GLASS'.  You may need to create a UNIX
     account for GLASS$ prior to this step (depending on your
     local configuration).
  2) connect the trust from a WINDOWS DC using "User Manager
     for Domains"

Now join winbindd on the Samba PDC to the SAMBA domain using
the normal steps for adding a Samba server to an NT4 domain:
(note that smbd & nmbd must be running at this point)

   root# net rpc join -U root
   Password: <enter root password from smbpasswd file here>

Start winbindd and test the join with 'wbinfo -t'.

Now test the trust relationship by connecting to the SAMBA DC
(e.g. POGO) as a user from the WINDOWS domain:

   $ smbclient //pogo/netlogon -U Administrator -W WINDOWS
   Password:

Now connect to the WINDOWS DC (e.g. CRYSTAL) as a Samba user:

   $ smbclient //crystal/netlogon -U root -W WINDOWS
   Password:

######################################################################
Changes in Winbind
##################

Beginning with Samba3.0.0beta3, winbindd has been given new account
manage functionality equivalent to the 'add user script' family of
smb.conf parameters.  The idmap design has also been changed to 
centralize control of foreign SID lookups and matching to UNIX 
uids and gids.


Brief Description of Changes
----------------------------

1) The sid_to_uid() family of functions (smbd/uid.c) have been 
   reverted to the 2.2.x design.  This means that when resolving a 
   SID to a UID or similar mapping:

        a) First consult winbindd
        b) perform a local lookup only if winbindd fails to
           return a successful answer

   There are some variations to this, but these two rules generally
   apply.

2) All idmap lookups have been moved into winbindd.  This means that
   a server must run winbindd (and support NSS) in order to achieve
   any mappings of SID to dynamically allocated UNIX ids.  This was
   a conscious design choice.

3) New functions have been added to winbindd to emulate the 'add user 
   script' family of smbd functions without requiring that external
   scripts be defined.  This functionality is controlled by the 'winbind 
   enable local accounts' smb.conf parameter (enabled by default).

   However, this account management functionality is only supported 
   in a local tdb (winbindd_idmap.tdb).  If these new UNIX accounts 
   must be shared among multiple Samba servers (such as a PDC and BDCs), 
   it will be necessary to define your own 'add user script', et. al.
   programs that place the accounts/groups in some form of directory
   such as NIS or LDAP.  This requirement was deemed beyond the scope
   of winbind's account management functions.  Solutions for 
   distributing UNIX system information have been deployed and tested 
   for many years.  We saw no need to reinvent the wheel.

4) A member of a Samba controlled domain running winbindd is now able 
   to map domain users directly onto existing UNIX accounts while still
   automatically creating accounts for trusted users and groups.  This
   behavior is controlled by the 'winbind trusted domains only' smb.conf
   parameter (disabled by default to provide 2.2.x winbind behavior).

5) Group mapping support is wrapped in the local_XX_to_XX() functions
   in smbd/uid.c.  The reason that group mappings are not included
   in winbindd is because the purpose of Samba's group map is to
   match any Windows SID with an existing UNIX group.  These UNIX
   groups can be created by winbindd (see next section), but the
   SID<->gid mapping is retreived by smbd, not winbindd.


Examples
--------

* security = server running winbindd to allocate accounts on demand

* Samba PDC running winbindd to handle the automatic creation of UNIX
  identities for machine trust accounts

* Automtically creating UNIX user and groups when migrating a Windows NT
  4.0 PDC to a Samba PDC.  Winbindd must be running when executing
  'net rpc vampire' for this to work.
