Commands accepted by hostapd via remote control:
==================================================

Most useful commands:
----------------------------

STATUS -- shows some status information
SETBSS [-nosave] <tag>=<value>   -- set per-bss config parameter 
        into the running program and then into the config file.
        (The bss selected depends upon which ctrl interface you talk to!).
        Note RECONFIGURE may be needed to take full effect! depending
        upon whether affect propogation has been properly coded.
        (With -nosave, nothing is saved to file; affect is only temporary
        or may not occur if affect propogation has not been properly coded).
        For a full list, see examples/ap_bss_example.conf .
SETRADIO [-nosave] <tag>=<value>   -- set per-radio config parameter 
        into the running program and then into the config file.
        (The radio selected depends upon which ctrl interface you talk to!).
        Note RECONFIGURE may be needed to take full effect! depending
        upon whether affect propogation has been properly coded.
        (With -nosave, nothing is saved to file; affect is only temporary
        or may not occur if affect propogation has not been properly coded).
        For a full list, see examples/ap_example_80211g.conf
RECONFIGURE   -- restart hostapd (same process id!), re-reading config files
        in the process. This may be necessary to get hostapd to properly
        recognize changes to configuration parameters.
        The restart is delayed by a few seconds, and results in disruption
        of all activities including wpatalk connections.
CONFIGSTOP -- stop any ongoing WPS operation
CONFIGME [pin=<pin>] [upnp={0|1}] [ssid=<ssid>] [bssid=<bssid>] (more...)
        Configure us from available WPS source; if successful, rew-writes
        the per-bss config file (a RECONFIGURE may be needed after this).
        See below for options.
CONFIGTHEM [pin=<pin>] [upnp={0|1}] [ssid=<ssid>] [bssid=<bssid>] (more...)
        Allow configuration of next requesting enrollee; no affect on
        our configuration.
        See below for options.
CONFIGIE [-nosave] [-norestart] <filepath>
        The raw WPS settings information elements from the given file are
        used to modify the current configuration including (unless prevented
        by -nosave) saving to configuration file and (unless prevented by
        -nosave or -norestart) restarting hostapd to properly use the new
        configuration.
        This can be used to transfer a new configuration from wpa_supplicant
        to hostapd for e.g. repeater case.
configme ....     -- lower case command name causes wpatalk to wait until done
configthem ....   -- lower case command name causes wpatalk to wait until done
QUIT -- terminate hostapd

/* CONFIGME [<tag>=<value>]...
 * Tags are:
 * pin=<digits>         -- specify password
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED: ssid=<text>          -- restrict search to given SSID
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED: ssid="<text>["]
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED: ssid=0x<hex>
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED: bssid=<hex>:<hex>:<hex>:<hex>:<hex>:<hex>  -- restrict search to given BSSID
 * nosave[={0|1}]       -- empty or 1 to do NOT save result back to config file
 * timeout=<seconds>    -- specify session timeout
 *                      (-1 for no timeout, 0 for default)
 *
 * If no PIN given, push button mode is assumed.
 * If nosave is not given, configuration is saved back to file,
 * but if it is given without a value then it is one (NOT saved).
 * ssid and/or bssid can be give as a filter,
 * after which there must be one PB-ready AP for PB mode;
 * for PIN mode there can be either one PIN-ready AP or else one
 * WPS-capable AP or else one open AP.
 *
 * NOTE: some registars (e.g. Windows Vista) just won't
 * configure (or even show) the access point UNLESS it
 * is marked as unconfigured (wps_state) which should be done by
 * modifying the per-bss config file (e.g. SETBSS wps_configured=0)
 * followed by restarting hostapd (e.g. RECONFIGURE).

------------------- Miscellaneous ------------------------------

Original hostapd commands:
PING		-- replies with "PONG\n" (like unix ping command)
        Note that this is used for a keepalive for control programs.
MIB 		-- reply with mib information (unimplemented?)
STA-FIRST 	-- reply with mib information (unimplemented?)
STA xxxxx	-- ? mib info ?
STA-NEXT xxxxxx	-- ? 
ATTACH          -- ? messages will now be sent to invoker of this command
DETACH          -- ? undo ATTACH
LEVEL <number>  -- change monitoring level (see ATTACH)
NEW_STA xxxx    -- ?
