wpatalk -- talk to running wpa_supplicant or hostapd program

Author:  Ted Merrill, Atheros Communications

History: based upon wpa_cli and hostapd_cli from the hostapd/wpa_supplicant
releases, with their built in commands replaced by more useful ones,
and with the option to pass raw commands to hostapd or wpa_supplicant.
In addition, one program (wpatalk) will handle either hostapd or
wpa_supplicant.
