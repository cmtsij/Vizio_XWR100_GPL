The GUI (from Sony) suffers from bit rot and no longer works.
This is for historical interest or in case someone wants to revive it.

============================================================================
WPS Client Operation -- Using Sony GUI
============================================================================

CURRENTLY BROKEN (need to convert to new wpa_supplicant commands)::::::::

If previously operated as an AP, it may be necessary to remove and
reassert the wifi card to work around some issues, as noted by Sony/Saice.
I haven't done this and have not seen any problem.

cd to "install" directory
Insure that sta_start is patched (see problem below)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib 
Run ./testbed_sta
Set:
  wireless interface -- ath0 (?)
  wireless driver -- madwifi (?)
  check "wireless IP address" and given an IP address that won't conflict
  uncheck "NFC interface"
  wired interface -- eth0 (see problem below)
  check "wired IP address" and given currently used IP address
  click "next"
  click "get configuration"
  click "push button"
Push button on AP
   click "start"
Should say "complete"
In another terminal window, cd to "install directory" and run "./wpa_cli";
use the command: save_config
and then:  q
[TODO?: add save_config button to interface or ?????????]
Back at testbed_sta, press "cancel" to quit it.
Manually edit wpa_supplicant.conf (in install directory) to fix problems
(see below).
Then manually start wpa_supplicant:
./wpa_supplicant -ddd -Dmadwifi -iath0 -c./wpa_supplicant.conf
In separate terminal window, cd to install directory:
./wpa_cli
select_network 0
q

Then set IP address for ath0, e.g.:
ifconfig ath0 192.168.1.99

Then test using ping..........

============================================================================
WPS Server Operation -- Using Sony GUI
============================================================================

CURRENTLY BROKEN (need to convert to new hostapd commands)::::::::

If previously operated as a STA, it may be necessary to remove and
reassert the wifi card to work around some issues, as noted by Sony/Saice...
i haven't noticed this myself.

cd to install directory
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib 
Run: ./testbed_ap
Make sure that "wired interface" says e.g. "eth0" and not "br0"
Unclick NFC box
Fix IP address as necessary
Hit next
Select reasonable values for ssid, key, etc.
"Configured" doesn't matter.
Hit next

hostapd should now be fully functional.

Use the dialog to do PIN or push button configuration of enrollees.
NOTE that in PIN method it does NOT produce WPS beacon IEs! and
the PIN must be provided from elsewhere.

============================================================================
Configuring access point -- using Sony GUI
============================================================================

CURRENTLY BROKEN (need to convert to new hostapd commands)::::::::

On laptop #1 (the "AP"): 

cd to install directory
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib 
Run: ./testbed_ap
Make sure that "wired interface" says e.g. "eth0" and not "br0"
Unclick NFC box
Fix IP address as necessary
Hit next.
Select reasonable values for ssid, key, etc.
"Configured" is advisory and matters for e.g. Windows Vista registrar
but not for sony wps STA.... set "unconfigured".
Hit next

hostapd should now be fully functional.

Select the "Get configuration" tab.

For PIN method, click on "Start authentication", then when that button
changes to say "Use default PIN", click on it again.
Note the displayed PIN, you will need it on registrar.

Alternative 1: On laptop #2 (the STA registrar):

Attach ethernet cable with connectivity to "AP" so you can test upnp
cd to "install" directory
Insure that sta_start is patched (see problem below)
Run ./testbed_sta
Set:
  wireless interface -- ath0 (?)
  wireless driver -- madwifi (?)
  check "wireless IP address" and give an IP address that won't conflict
  uncheck "NFC interface"
  wired interface -- eth0 (see problem below)
  check "wired IP address" and fix the IP address to match what you are using.
  click "next"
  click "configure access point"
  set reasonable network configuration
  click "next"
  click "PIN"
  Now you have a choice of in-band (wifi) or upnp; in either case,
    click "update" to update the list (the wifi list at least always
    seems to be out of date... actually, the list still has cruft even
    after update)
  Click on the desired AP and hit "next"
  Copy the PIN from the "AP" and hit "next"
  should quickly work.

Alternative 2: Using Windows Vista wired registrar
Note: you must have the AP in "unconfigured" state (see above).
Note: if there are any other "unconfigured" APs visible to Windows Vista
it is likely to insist on configuring the wrong one.
Note: if AP was previously seen as "configured" by Vista, you will need
to reset this by e.g. rebooting.
If in doubt, reboot Windows.

Make sure you can ping windows from the "AP".

Windows start icon -> startup -> network (make sure it shows your AP)
    -> sharing center -> setup connection -> set up access point -> next ...
    Copy the PIN from your "AP" and next --> should quickly work.
